# SPA start

Embed About page HTML into `index.html`.

Add ids to links (`home-page-link`, `about-page-link`) and pages (`home-page`, `about-page`).

Add JS logic for when link is clicked:

* Determine the new page ID from the clicked link's id.
* Add the Bootstrap `d-none` class to the currently visible page div.
* Remove `d-none` from the page we want to navigate to.
