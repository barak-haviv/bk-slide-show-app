# Add About page

Create an About page (`about.html`), with a lot of duplicate HTML to `index.html`.

Separate the contents of `style` into a separate CSS file, so we can reference it from both files.

Update the navbar on both pages to include links to both pages.

TODO `active` doesn't seem to have any effect.
